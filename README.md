# fluorometer-tests
This repo was made to move tests and test code from fluorometer-base. These tests will validate, display, and explain data results. For more info on the fluorometer, and to see current code, see repo "fluorometer-base"

This device is being made in conjunction with CU Design Center and Ball Aerospace for a NASA-funded project to clean the oceans.
